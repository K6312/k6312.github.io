## Syllabus

#### What is the module about

This module aims to prepare graduate students pursuing a master degree in business analytics for advanced data science topics and their application in business analytics. Therefore, we design this module to help students develop a deeper understanding of machine learning models and explore their applications.The tentative topics of this course include:

- data visualization and interpretable machine learning
- bayesian learning
- deep learning
- autoencoder
- variational autoencoder
- convolutional neural network
- recurrent neural network
- generative adversarial networks (GAN)
- attention model.

At the same time, we investigate several applications such as:

- sentiment analysis
- part-of-speech tagging
- name entity recognition
- machine translation
- automatic harry potter writing
- recommendation system
- image generation
- spam detection
- portfolio optimization

In summary, the key takeaways of this course are as follows:

- Understand the challenges of data collection, analysis and mining;
- Describe basic concepts and methods used in data science (E.g., data visualization, feature extraction, model ensemble, classification and clustering etc.);
- Understand conceptually the mechanism of advanced machine learning algorithms and their applications in the real-world;
- Select appropriate machine learning tools/ techniques to uncover patterns and relationships, extract useful knowledge and support decision making in business applications;
- Craft a real-world problem and assemble required tools to yield meaningful solutions and conclusions.

<u>The above is the tentative content, which may be modified during the semester.</u>

Course Policies
No Late Policy
Homework assignments will be posted on the website on Wednesdays and will be due the following Wednesday (listed in the course schedule). No homework assignments or project milestones will be accepted for credit after the deadline. If you have a verifiable medical condition or other special circumstances that interfere with your coursework please let us know as soon as possible by sending an email to the Helpline.

Collaboration Policy
We expect you to adhere to the Harvard Honor Code at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board.

The midterm must be completed entirely on your own, and may not be discussed with anybody else!

Homework may be completed in collaboration with at most one other student for part or all of the homework. If you are submitting the same homework you are required to do so in a group. Homework may not be divided up - all collaborators must work on all problems. If you worked with someone but submitted different papers, please include the name in the Comments (details to follow)

You are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. In particular:

you have to write your solutions entirely on your own or with your collaborator;
you should not view any written materials or code created by anyone else for the assignment;
you should list your collaborator.
you may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future.
If the assignment allows it you may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers.

Accessibility
Any student receiving accommodations through the Accessible Education Office should present their AEO letter to the Head TF as soon as possible. Failure to do so may prevent us from making appropriate arrangements.

Course Resources
Online Materials
All course materials, including handouts, slides, problem sets, and midterms, will be posted on Canvas.

Discussion Forum
We use Piazza as our discussion forum. All official announcements via Canvas so make sure you have your Canvas notifications turned on. Piazza should always be your first resource for seeking answers to your questions. 

Getting Help
For questions about homework, course content, package installation, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is:
1. Post the question in Piazza and hopefully your peers will answer. Note that in Piazza questions are visible to everyone. You can also post privately so that only the staff sees your message.
2. Go to TF Office Hours.
3. For admin issues and requests for regrades and extensions send an email to the Helpline:
FAS student Helpline: cs109b2018@gmail.com
DCE student Helpline: cse109b2018@gmail.com
4. For personal matters send an email to either or both of the instructors.

Instructor Office Hours
Pavlos: Monday 3-4pm MD G109 

Mark: By appointment

Staff Office Hours
Most TF Office Hours will available in person and concurrently online via Zoom for distance education students and local students. Office hour times and locations will be listed in Canvas. Office hours provide you with an opportunity to review and discuss course material as well as provide further guidance for your homework directly with your teaching fellow with maybe a handful of classmates present.

Credits
Some of the material in this course is based on other classes. We have also heavily drawn on materials and examples found online and tried our best to give credit by linking to the original source. Please contact us if you find materials where the credit is missing or that you would rather have removed.
