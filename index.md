# K6312 INFORMATION MINING & ANALYSIS

#### <center>NTU, WKW / Spring 2020</center>

## <font color='Red'>Course Description </font>

Nowadays, with the popularity of the Internet, there is a massive amount of data available, and it becomes an important resource for mining useful knowledge. From a business and government point of view, there is an increasing need to interpret and act upon the large-volume data.

This course is an introduction to data (or information) mining and analysis, and covers how to analyse structured data. Students will learn various machine learning (or statistical learning) techniques and tools both through lectures and hands-on exercises in labs.
Students will learn following topics in the course:

* Principles and concepts of text and web mining.
* Various machine learning techniques: linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree induction, K-Nearest Neighbors classification, Bayesian learning, support vector machines, K-means clustering, etc.
* Evaluation metrics and methods, such as precision, recall, F-1 score, and cross-validation.
* Practical use of data mining to real world applications.

### Course Objectives:

At the end of this course, students should be able to:

- Appreciate the basics of data mining and analysis.
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of different data mining techniques.
- Work on practical problems that can be solved using data mining techniques.

### Prerequisites:

- The student has some aptitude for low-level logical thinking since lectures and labs will focus
on technical aspects of Data Mining and Analysis.

Basic computer programming skill is required before you take this course. Also it would be helpful if you have some basic knowledge of mathematics and statistics.

### Method of Assessment:
Coursework (individual and group assignments): 40% (40 marks)
Class Participation (class interactions and attendance): 10% (10 marks)
Final examination: 50% (50 marks); 3 hours closed book exam

### Reference Books

The following books are helpful, but not required. You will easily get these books from Internet.


- Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing *Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Sch√ºtze*
- Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing *Yoav Goldberg*
- Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python : With Application to Understanding Data *John V. Guttag* 
- Applied Text Analysis with Python *Benjamin Bengfort* 

If you are not proficient in python, you may find [some tutorials](material/coding.md) helpful.

### Class Participation (5%)

We aapreciate everyone being actively involved in the class! There are serveral ways of earning participation credit, which is capped at 5%:

1. **Attending guest speakers' lectures**: In the semester, we have two invitied speakers, who are making a great efforts to come lecture for us. We do not want them speaking to a empty room. Your attendance at lectures with guest spearks is expected! In addition, it will be a very awesome chance for networking! You will get 1% per speark (total 2%) for attending.
2. **Attending two random lectures**: We are going to take attendance at two randonly-selected (non-guest) lectures in the quarter. Each is worth 1% (total 2%).
3. **Karma Point**: Any other act that improves the class, which instructors notics and deems worthy: 1%. 

### Kaggle Competition (8%)

H6751 will host a internal 5 weeks text mining competition. The deatils will be announced later. 


### Individual In-class Assignment (12%)

We are going to have a two-hour in-class assignment, which covers programming. The details will be announced later. 

### Group Project (30%)

You are required to form a project group with 3-4 members. This is a text mining project where you collect your own sample text dataset (or use an existing dataset), and using text mining techniques and tools, build an interesting model / application that mines knowledge/information from the text dataset. Generally, the project scope is entirely up to you, but I suggest that you build a useful and interesting application. Then, write a project report explaining your methodology and presenting the results and present your work in class. The detailed information can be found [here](project/project.md).


- **Credit**:
  * Project report (15%) 
  * Project presentation (15%)

### Final Exam (45%)

We will prepare a review session before the final exam.
