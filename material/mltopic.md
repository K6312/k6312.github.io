## Syllabus

#### What is the module about

This module aims to prepare graduate students pursuing a master degree in business analytics for advanced data science topics and their application in business analytics. Therefore, we design this module to help students develop a deeper understanding of machine learning models and explore their applications.The tentative topics of this course include:

- data visualization and interpretable machine learning
- bayesian learning
- deep learning
- autoencoder
- variational autoencoder
- convolutional neural network
- recurrent neural network
- generative adversarial networks (GAN)
- attention model.

At the same time, we investigate several applications such as:

- sentiment analysis
- part-of-speech tagging
- name entity recognition
- machine translation
- automatic harry potter writing
- recommendation system
- image generation
- spam detection
- portfolio optimization

In summary, the key takeaways of this course are as follows:

- Understand the challenges of data collection, analysis and mining;
- Describe basic concepts and methods used in data science (E.g., data visualization, feature extraction, model ensemble, classification and clustering etc.);
- Understand conceptually the mechanism of advanced machine learning algorithms and their applications in the real-world;
- Select appropriate machine learning tools/ techniques to uncover patterns and relationships, extract useful knowledge and support decision making in business applications;
- Craft a real-world problem and assemble required tools to yield meaningful solutions and conclusions.

<u>The above is the tentative content, which may be modified during the semester.</u>
