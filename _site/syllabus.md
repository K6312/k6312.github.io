## Syllabus

### Homework and final project

We currently planned for 3 homework assignments, on kernel machines, GANs, and reinforcement learning.

There will be a final report due on Wednesday March 20, 11:59 PM.

The grade will be computed as follows:

- 3 homework assignments: 60%
- 1 final project: 40%

For late policy, we will accept assignments up to 2 day late, with a 10% penalty. Assignments will not be accepted after that. Email [Eric Darve](mailto:darve@stanford.edu) to request an exception (e.g., travel to a conference, illness in the family).

There will not be any late days for the final project.

Homework assignments will be submitted using gradescope. To register for this class on gradescope use the following code: MPW2X3. The link is

Most of you should be registered already.

### Meeting times

The class is scheduled Monday, Wednesday, Friday 1:30PM-2:50PM in 200-205. But, we will only use 2 days out of 3. We will keep the third day for special lectures (make-up, guest, etc). We are planning on having most lectures on Monday and Wednesday.

### Discussion forum

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and the instructor. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com).

Find our class page at: [https://piazza.com/stanford/winter2019/me343/home](https://piazza.com/stanford/winter2019/me343/home).

Because emails from instructors tend to get filtered out, we will also use a mailing list to email everyone. This mailing list can help you differentiate messages from the forum from important messages from the teaching staff. The mailing list is
[me343-winter1819@lists.stanford.edu](mailto:me343-winter1819@lists.stanford.edu)

Most of you should be signed up already. The landing page is:

### Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE).  Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The [OAE](http://oae.stanford.edu) is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066).

### Honor code

The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students, individually and collectively:

1. that they will not give or receive aid in examinations; that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of grading;
2. that they will do their share and take an active part in seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor Code.

### Violations of the Honor Code

Examples of conduct that have been regarded as being in violation of the Honor Code include:

- Copying from another's examination paper or allowing another to copy from one's own paper
- Unpermitted collaboration
- Plagiarism
- Revising and resubmitting a quiz or exam for regrading, without the instructor's knowledge and consent
- Giving or receiving unpermitted aid on a take-home examination
- Representing as one's own work the work of another
