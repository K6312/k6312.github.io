### Selected Reports for 2019 Spring

#### Group 3

> The report content is generally quite well done. There is good effort put in to construct dataset for their problem needs by combining various sources of data using various tools, which includes data gathering, cleaning, and transformation. This is in contrast to groups that just obtain data from a data source and sometimes just using it without analysis. There is also good work done in experimenting with various models with fine-tuning details clearly stated. Even constant/ adaptive learning rates, different activation functions, and weights for L2 regularisation were experimented for their neural network models. However, the report needs to be penalised due to the group leaving all important figures and results in the Appendix, which should have been regarded as optional materials. There is also a weird section where movie similarity is said to be useful to predict revenue, yet the group uses it just to identify similar movies instead of using this as a feature to predict movie revenue.
