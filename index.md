# BT5153 Applied Machine Learning for Business Analytics

##### <center>NUS, MSBA / Spring 2020</center>

## <font color='DarkOrange'>Content</font>

This module aims to prepare graduate students pursuing a master degree in business analytics for advanced data science topics and their application in business analytics. Therefore, we design this module to help students develop a deeper understanding of machine learning models and explore their applications.The tentative topics of this course include: data visualization and interpretable machine learning, bayesian learning, deep learning, autoencoder, variational autoencoder, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, generative adversarial networks (GAN), attention model and so on. At the same time, we investigate several applications such as various Natural Language processing tasks (sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, name entity recognition, machine translation, and automatic harry potter writing), recommendation system, image generation, spam detection, portfolio optimization and face recognition.

In summary, the key takeaways of this course are as follows:

- Understand the challenges of data collection, analysis and mining;
- Describe basic concepts and methods used in data science (E.g., data visualization, feature extraction, model ensemble, classification and clustering etc.);
- Understand conceptually the mechanism of advanced machine learning algorithms and their applications in the real-world;
- Select appropriate machine learning tools/ techniques to uncover patterns and relationships, extract useful knowledge and support decision making in business applications;
- Craft a real-world problem and assemble required tools to yield meaningful solutions and conclusions.

<u>The above is the tentative content, which may be modified during the semester.</u>

#### Assignments (25%)

There are two assignments. One is a weekly assignment and the other is a mini four-weeks kaggle competition. 

- **Credit**:
  * Assignment 1 (10%): 
  * Kaggle competition (15%):
 

#### Midterm Exam (20%)

Students are expected to attend the Midterm Examination. It will be open-book and open-notes. It will focus on the application of the materials covered in class. The mode of the delivery of the examination will be determined and announced later.

#### Group Project （50%）

You are required to form a project group with 4-5 members. Your project task is to apply the data mining and machine learning techniques that you have acquired to gain insights and draw interesting conclusions to a (business) problem. You are to apply (advanced) data mining and analytics tools (preferably in Python as Python tools are used as supplementary aids during the delivery of this course) to process structured and unstructured data available on the Web. You will then summarize your insights and present your conclusions using suitable visual aids.

- **Credit**:
  * Project proposal (10%) 
  * Project presentation (25%)
  * Project final report (15%)
