1. You should be able to understand how to use HMM for sequential tagging problem.
2. How to adopt the open-sourced code in your own domain? Given the ipython notebook that uses HMM for POS Tagging, you need to modify it for NER. As a data scientist, 80% of your duty should fall into this category. 
3. You should be able to understand the intent of the code and be able to look up google and debug it.
