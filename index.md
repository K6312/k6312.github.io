Welcome to this class. We hope you will enjoy it!

This module aims to prepare graduate students pursuing a master degree in business analytics for advanced data science topics and their application in business analytics. Here is he focus of this course will be how to apply these techniques on real business problems, where we look at several applications including sentiment analysis, recommendation system, machine translation, text summarization, portfolio optimization, spam detection, automatic harry potter writing and so on.the tentative topics of this course:
- Data visualization and interpretable machine learning
- Bayesian learning (Naive Bayes and Hidden markov model)
- Deep learning
- Autoencoder
- Variational Autoencoder
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Attention model
- Seq2seq model

At the same time, the focus of this course will be how to apply these techniques on real business problems, where we look at several applications:
- sentiment analysis
- part-of-speech tagging
- name entity recognition
- recommendation system
- machine translation
- portfolio optimization
- image generation
- spam detection
- automatic harry potter writing and so on.

The above is the tentative content, which may be modified during the semester.
