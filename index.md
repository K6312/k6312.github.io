# BT5153 Applied Machine Learning for Business Analytics

#### <center>NUS, MSBA / Spring 2020</center>

## <font color='DarkOrange'>Content</font>

This module provides students a deep overview of various advanced machine learning technqiues applied to business analytics tasks. The tentative topics include machine learning pipeline, unsupervised learning, structure learning, bayesian learning, deep learning and generative models. The programming languages used will be Python.

### Class participation (5%)

Class participation.

### Assignments (25%)

There are two assignments. One is a weekly assignment and the other is a mini four-weeks kaggle competition. Students are expected to complete these two individual assignment to gauge their understanding of the course materials so as to prepare them for their Group Project and future data science tasks. Through lectures and programming assignments students will learn the necessary engineering tricks for making neural networks work on practical problems. Details of the individual assignment will be announced later. 

- **Credit**:
  * Assignment 1 (10%): 
  * Kaggle competition (15%):
 

### Midterm Exam (20%)

Students are expected to attend the Midterm Examination. It will be open-book and open-notes. It will focus on the application of the materials covered in class. The mode of the delivery of the examination will be determined and announced later.

### Group Project （50%）

You are required to form a project group with 4-5 members. Your project task is to apply the data mining and machine learning techniques that you have acquired to gain insights and draw interesting conclusions to a (business) problem. You are to apply (advanced) data mining and analytics tools (preferably in Python as Python tools are used as supplementary aids during the delivery of this course) to process structured and unstructured data available on the Web. You will then summarize your insights and present your conclusions using suitable visual aids.

- **Credit**:
  * Project proposal (10%) 
  * Project presentation (25%)
  * Project final report (15%)
